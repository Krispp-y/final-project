# Khryzti F

- Hello!! My name is Khryzti and I started coding this school year!! I've always been interested in math/stem so I thought this class/computer science would be fun :)

- Over this school year, I've learned about the basics and principles (ap comp sci principles duhh) of coding, from variables to functions, and how the internet works (ip addresses, domains, routers, etc). Along with learning the basics of coding, I also learned many languages, such as C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Scratch. Using these languages, guidance from the class,  and my knowledge on coding I created these projects throughout the school year :)
