# Khryzti F.

hello!! my name is khryzti, and I started coding this school year. I've always been interested in math/stem so I thought this class computer science would be fun!!!

over this school year I have learned about the basics and principles of coding from variables to functions, and how the internet works (ip addresses domains routers etc), along with learning the basics of coding. I also learned many languages such as C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Scratch. using these languages, guidance from the class, and my knowledge on coding i created these projects throughout the school year ^_^
this project is one big organized portfolio to showcase them!
